# Booking Rental App (Frontend scaffold)

This is a minimal React + Vite scaffold for the Booking Rental App project focusing on frontend features and booking workflow. It uses Tailwind CSS and localStorage for persistence.

Quick start (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
cd "D:\Booking App\booking rental app"
npm install
npm run dev
```

What I added:
- Vite + React entry files
- Tailwind CSS config
- Basic pages: Home, Listing, Host Dashboard, Bookings
- Listing and Booking services (localStorage seed data)
- Simple ListingCard component

Next steps I can take for you:
- Implement booking UI with date range picker and availability checks
- Add forms for creating/editing listings
- Add tests and CI
- Swap to JSON Server or Firebase for persistence
